          "text": "Biden raises election meddling with Putin in first phone call Published 5 hours ago\n\nimage copyright Getty Images\n\nUS President Joe Biden has warned Russian leader Vladimir Putin about election meddling in their first call as counterparts, the White House says.\n\nThe conversation included a discussion about the ongoing opposition protests in Russia and an extension of the last remaining US-Russia nuclear arms pact.\n\nMr Putin congratulated the new US president on winning the election, according to a Russian statement.\n\nBoth parties said they agreed to maintain contact moving forward.\n\nFormer US President Donald Trump sometimes undercut his own administration's tough posture on Russia and was accused of being too deferential to Mr Putin.\n\nBut former President Barack Obama - under whom Mr Biden served as vice-president - was also criticised for failing to check the Kremlin as it annexed Crimea, invaded eastern Ukraine and muscled in on Syria.\n\nWhat did the White House and Kremlin say about the call?\n\n\"President Biden made clear that the United States will act firmly in defence of its national interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,\" a US statement said.\n\nA White House readout of Tuesday afternoon's call said that the two presidents also discussed the massive SolarWinds cyber-attack, which has been blamed on Moscow, reports that the Kremlin placed bounties on US soldiers in Afghanistan, and the poisoning of Russian opposition activist Alexei Navalny.\n\nThe Kremlin readout of the call did not refer to any points of friction the White House said had been raised by Mr Biden, who has in the past referred to Mr Putin as \"a KGB thug\".\n\nRussian officials said their president had \"noted that the normalisation of relations between Russia and the United States would meet the interests of both countries and - taking into account their special responsibility for maintaining security and stability in the world - of the entire international community\".\n\n\"On the whole, the conversation between the leaders of Russia and the United States was of a business-like and frank nature,\" the Kremlin statement added.\n\nThe two leaders appeared to seal an agreement to renew New Start, an Obama-era accord that limits the amounts of warheads, missiles and launchers in the US-Russian nuclear arsenals.\n\nIt was due to expire next month, and Mr Trump had refused to sign on.\n\nBiden doesn't want a confrontation\n\nJoe Biden had indicated he would be tougher on Vladimir Putin than Donald Trump, who refused to take on the Kremlin and frequently cast doubt on Russian interference in the 2016 elections.\n\nOn that matter Mr Biden made his sharpest break with Mr Trump, reportedly telling Mr Putin that he knew Russia had tried to meddle in both the 2016 and 2020 elections. He also warned the Russian president that the US was ready to defend itself against cyber-espionage, and any other attacks.\n\nDespite Mr Trump's conciliatory approach, the Kremlin did not benefit from his presidency, because his administration heavily sanctioned Russians for issues ranging from Ukraine to attacks on dissidents. Joe Biden and his foreign policy team will take a robust position on human rights and Mr Putin's intentions in Europe.\n\nBut they are not looking for a confrontation.\n\nRather, they hope to manage relations and co-operate where possible. In that vein, the two presidents did agree to work at completing the extension of the new Start arms control treaty before it expires next month.\n\nWhat else did Biden do today?\n\nThe call with the Kremlin comes as Mr Biden's nominee for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, was confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 78-22.\n\nMr Biden later appeared at the White House to sign four executive orders aimed at addressing what he called US systemic racism.\n\n\"This is the time to act and it's to act because it's what the core values of this nation call us to do. I believe the vast majority of Democrats, Republicans and Independents share these values and want us to act as well,\" said Mr Biden.\n\nThe president directed the Department of Justice not to renew contracts with private prison operators, though advocates noted the order does not cover privately run immigration detention centres.\n\nmedia caption Biden: \"Systemic racism is corrosive, destructive and costly\"\n\nMr Biden also directed the Department of Housing and Urban Development to take steps to eradicate racism from housing policy.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post, the department will reinstate a 2013 rule on \"disparate impact\" that aims to block the real estate sector from requiring tenants to undergo criminal background checks, or using artificial intelligence to forecast creditworthiness.\n\nThe new orders also recommit the US government to respect tribal sovereignty. This is not seen as a significant change from existing federal policy, but some Native American officials have said their objections to public land decisions were ignored under the Trump administration.\n\nMr Biden also signed a directive rejecting coronavirus-related discrimination against the Asian-American and Pacific Islander communities.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice-President Kamala Harris received her second coronavirus vaccine dose at a federal health agency in Washington DC, saying: \"I want to urge everyone to take the vaccine when it's your turn.\""

It is his duty to provide security of all agents,\" he said.\n\nShahadat said he spoke with the presiding officer. \"The presiding officer needs to act neutral as he is part of Election Commission. It is their responsibility,\" he added.\n\nBGB, police personnel, executive magistrate arrived at Shahidnagar City Corporation Girls High School polling centre but didn't take any action rather than blowing whistle.\n\nBNP polling agents claimed to have been driven out from polling centres including Shah Waliullah Institute, Lok Proshashon, Saleh Jahur School, Khastogir School and National Primary School.\n\nVoters at Shahidnagar City Corporation Girls High School in Lalkhanbazar alleged that supporters of AL candidate barred them from entering the centre. A few women voters were seen protesting and demanding to be allowed to enter to cast their votes.\n\nA female voter at the same centre alleged that a polling agent had cast her vote.\n\nShe also said that polling officials didn't pay any heed when she tried to complain.\n\nWhen our staff correspondent asked the voter to identify said polling agent, police and AL men barred him, saying the incident was \"not a big deal\".\n\nPresiding Officer refused to make any comment regarding the matter, saying he is busy."

          "text": "More than 19 lakh voters are going to decide today the outcome of a high-voltage contest between the ruling Awami League and its archrival BNP in the Chattogram City Corporation election amid tight security.\n\nThis is the first time the port city polls are being held under party banner and also through electronic voting machines (EVMs).\n\nThough seven mayoral candidates are contesting the polls, the main contest is likely to take place between AL's Rezaul Karim Chowdhury and BNP's Shahadat Hossain.\n\nVoting will start at 8:00am and continue till 4:00pm without any break.\n\nElection observers as well as the city residents will keep their eyes on the polls with 22 AL rebel candidates vying for councillor posts in 22 of the 41 wards. The rebels remain a major concern for the ruling party which could not deter them from contesting the polls despite repeated attempts.\n\nIn reality, the local body to be formed through people's mandate will not be able to solve many of the decades-old problems of the the city residents due to constraints on its jurisdiction. Yet, there had been a lot of excitement in the run-up to the polls due to the presence of a large number of AL rebel candidates.\n\nTalking to The Daily Star at his office yesterday, Returning Officer Mohammad Hasanuzzaman said they have taken all measures to hold the local body election in a free and fair manner.\n\n\"My appeal to the voters is that they go to the polling centres without any fear and cast ballots for whoever they want. We have taken all-out measures so that voters can return home safely after casting votes.\"\n\nHe warned that stern action will be taken if anyone tries to ruin the election atmosphere.\n\n\"We have covered the city corporation area in a security blanket.\n\n\"There is no concern over any possible untoward incident during the election.\"\n\nDespite the assurance, the BNP camp is apprehensive about the holding of a free and fair election. A number of party leaders have alleged that police are harassing and arresting their activists in \"false cases\".\n\nBNP candidate Shahadat was seen busy yesterday putting pressure on the RO so that law enforcement agencies do not harass his party men involved in election activities.\n\nAround 2:00pm, he went to the Election Commission Office and submitted a written complaint mentioning that 56 of his polling agents without criminal records were arrested in police raids in different areas of the city between Monday night and yesterday morning.\n\nThe RO assured him that no polling agents would be barred from entering the centres on the election day.\n\nTalking to reporters later, Shahadat said the arrest of his polling agents just days before the voting day ruined the election atmosphere.\n\n\"The government is paving the way for holding a one-sided election through vote rigging.\"\n\nMembers of law enforcement agencies have stoked fear among BNP leaders and activists over the last week by raiding houses of many party loyalists. They are arresting those who are working in the field and do not have any criminal record, he alleged.\n\n\"We tried a lot to create a festive atmosphere so that people become interested to go to polling centres and vote, but now panic and fear have set in,\" he said.\n\nOn the other hand, AL candidate Rezaul spent the day with party leaders and activists, having discussions on their tasks on the voting day.\n\nBefore leaving his residence around 11.30am, he talked to journalists and expressed satisfaction over the election atmosphere.\n\nSECURITY BLANKET\n\nHasanuzzaman said 416 of the 735 polling stations in the city were identified as risky, and 18 members of police and ansar will be deployed in each of those. Besides, 16 members of law enforcement agencies will stand guard at each of the remaining 319 polling centres.\n\nA total of 15,000 members of the BGB, Rab, police and ansar have been deployed all over the port city for holding the election in a free and fair manner.\n\nMoreover, 69 executive and 20 judicial magistrates will carry out election duties in the 41 wards of the city, the RO mentioned.\n\nEarlier in the morning, Hasanuzzaman distributed EVMs and other materials among the presiding officers of different polling centres.\n\nBack in 1994, AL leader ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury became the first democratically-elected mayor of the port city. He later became CCC mayor for two consecutive terms.\n\nBNP-backed M Manjur Alam was elected mayor in 2010. Then AL-backed AJM Nasir Uddin became mayor in 2015.\n\nThe CCC polls were scheduled to be held in March last year. But it had to be deferred due to the Covid pandemic.\n\nThe CCC is third among the country's 12 city corporations in terms of number of voters."

          "text": "Many traders indiscriminately stockpiled rice, potato, and onion to drive up prices even when there was a supply surplus.\n\nIn the meantime, government interventions wholly failed to manage the crisis.\n\nThese findings of three study teams from Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council were revealed yesterday at a press conference at the capital's Barc office.\n\nThe agriculture ministry initiated the market research on October 20 last year following public outcry over the prices. The ministry formed the three teams to investigate why prices of the three essential food items soared in the market.\n\nIn the months following the monsoon in mid-October, onion prices rose as high as Tk 80 per kg at the wholesale market and Tk 90-95 at the retail, while each kg of potato was sold for Tk 50 at the retail front. Even prices of rice went beyond the reach of many. Different varieties of the staple, like Miniket and Nazirshail, was sold at Tk 60 per kg.\n\nThe study teams found that 52 percent of farmers sold their Boro paddy within a month of harvesting, and only an insignificant minority (five percent) sold it more than four months after the harvest.\n\n\"It means, when the price of rice increased, the staple was not with the farmers,\" Prof Jahangir Alam, a former director-general of Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute and the coordinator of the study teams, told the press conference yesterday.\n\n\"The millers told us that Boro production decreased resulting in the high prices, but the farmers told us that Boro production had actually increased. Sure, Aman production was less than usual, but there was plenty of Boro in stock,\" he added.\n\nThe per person demand for rice per day is 551gm, while the per person availability was 621gm (per day), estimated the teams.\n\nThe teams found that the cost of rice processing (by millers) had gone up because of increased transportation costs. Despite this, the millers still made Tk 4.7 in profit for every kg during the Boro season and Tk 5.2 per kg during the Aman season.\n\n\"If you take only rice into consideration, the profit would not be noticeable, but millers produce a lot of by-products, and those widened the profit margin,\" said Md Abdur Rouf Sarkar, senior scientific officer of Agricultural Economics Division at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute while presenting the findings of one of the teams.\n\nThe profit, however, was less than that of other years.\n\nThe team also pointed at the government's failure in procuring rice. \"The government rice stock had gone down to as little as 5 lakh tonnes,\" said Rouf.\n\nThe team recommended that the government should always maintain a reserve of at least 12.5 lakh tonnes of rice every month to control market prices during August-October.\n\nAgriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque admitted that the government had failed to procure rice from the farmers. \"Last year our procurement price was lower than the market price, so farmers refused to sell [their produce] to us. Last year, we could not even procure Tk 1 lakh tonnes of grains,\" he commented.\n\n\"We opened up rice imports to ease the market, but the traders refused to import it saying that the 25 percent import duty would not let them make profit,\" he added.\n\n\"Millers and wholesalers are now controlling the market,\" he said.\n\nThe price of Aman rice was 74 percent more than what it was in 2019, the team found, while the price of Aman paddy almost doubled.\n\nAnother team found similar reasons behind the increase in potato prices.\n\n\"There was a surplus of 3.41 lakh metric tonnes,\" said Prof Dr Shaikh Abdus Sabur of the Department of Agribusiness and Marketing at Bangladesh Agricultural University, presenting the findings of the team.\n\nThe price of potatoes peaked after September and October, while data shows that between July and November, the cold-storage facilities released on average 16.3 percent of their stored potatoes, while the selling price of potatoes shot up to Tk 1,650 per 40kg. In March, when 65 percent of potatoes were released from the storages, the price had been Tk 470 for 40kg.\n\n\"The main cause of this price hike was the artificial crisis created by profit-seeking traders, rather than low production and high consumption of potatoes,\" concluded the team.\n\n\"Market intervention by Trading Corporation of Bangladesh [TCB] was also very much limited. TCB only sold 215.5 metric tonnes of potatoes so far in different districts,\" found the team.\n\nThe national demand was 6,817,000 metric tonnes and TCB's intervention was a drop in the bucket.\n\nStockpiling was also the primary reason behind the price increase of onions, found another of the study teams.\n\nThe net demand for onions was 22.92 lakh metric tonnes, while the supply was 25.77 metric tonnes, said Dr Md Abdur Rashid, chief scientific officer at Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute.\n\n\"When India stopped onion exports, the traders started stockpiling onions,\" he said.\n\nAccording to data collected from Faridpur, Pabna and Natore, following the export ban by India, onions were released into the market slowly.\n\n\"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a lot of migrant workers returned from overseas. They turned to onion business and most of their investment was in hoarding of onions, but they did not dispose of the onion in time, raising the prices,\" he added."
