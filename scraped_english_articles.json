Meanwhile, 10 new mass vaccination centres will open in England, including at Blackburn Cathedral in Lancashire, and Taunton racecourse in Somerset."

          "title": "Remittance Inflow: Proactive steps can fetch $30b a year",
          "text": "The country could receive as much as $30 billion in remittance annually if proactive steps are taken by the government and other stakeholders, including the banking sector, speakers said at a dialogue yesterday.\n\nThey said the use of formal channels to remit money home was still not at the level. The channel also lacked the required \"speed\" to encourage more remitters to use it and the speakers suggested that further government incentives could encourage them to use the formal channel.\n\nCitizen's Platform for SDGs, Bangladesh, organised the virtual dialogue titled \"Recent Expatriate Income or Remittance Inflow: Where is the money coming from?\"\n\nBangladeshi expatriates sent home $21.75 billion in remittance last year, according to Bureau of Manpower, Employment and Training data, which cites Bangladesh Bank statistics.\n\nThe amount is a record high and it also defied predictions made at the onset of the global economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAddressing the dialogue, Anisul Islam Mahmud, chairman of the parliamentary committee on expatriates' welfare and overseas employment ministry, said it is possible that the country will receive $30 billion in remittance every year in the future.\n\n\"The money is there,\" he said, adding that yearly remittance inflow is yet to hit the $30 billion mark because such money is still not coming through the formal channels.\n\nThe banking sector was yet to provide services with sufficient \"speed\", which the non-formal sector ensures, he said.\n\nHe added that the government's two percent cash incentive was a reason for the increase in recent remittance inflow and suggested it would be sustainable with a further increase in the incentive.\n\nSyed Saiful Haque, chairman of Welfare Association for the Rights of Bangladeshi Emigrants (WARBE) Development Foundation, said it is not surprising that the country received about $20 billion remittance in a year.\n\nHe referred to a study of the Bangladesh Enterprise Institute, conducted about a decade ago, and said the study then revealed that it was possible to get about $30 billion in remittance annually.\n\nIf the government and other stakeholders, including the banking sector, work proactively, then it is most likely that inward remittance will continue to surge, he added.\n\nSaiful also suggested that \"visa-trading\" be stopped in this regard through bilateral initiatives, adding that about $3 billion to $4 billion was spent for \"visa purchasing\" every year.\n\nSyed Mahbubur Rahman, managing director and chief executive officer of Mutual Trust Bank, said in the case of remitting money, \"speed\" and \"trust\" are important because those who remit money look at how quickly, especially in cases of emergency, the money reached their dear ones back home.\n\nHe said the government recently re-determined the maximum time limit to distribute remittance to the beneficiary in two working days, which was 72 hours earlier.\n\nSuch steps are largely being implemented at present and this has helped in the increase of remittance inflow, he said.\n\nChairing and moderating the dialogue, Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, convener of the citizen's platform and distinguished fellow of Centre of Policy Dialogue (CPD), said although there were various reasons behind the recent inward remittance increase, there is no doubt that the government's two percent cash incentive was a key reason.\n\nRemittance kept coming in large amounts, but even greater amount of expatriates' earnings may have been involved in different market-oriented sectors, he said.\n\nWhether such money was inflowing through a \"third channel\" instead of reaching the beneficiaries directly from the wage-earners is a matter to look into, Debapriya added.\n\nAddressing the dialogue, CPD Chairman and eminent economist Prof Rehman Sobhan said although the government's two percent cash incentive for inward remittance was a positive step, the macro beneficiary of it is the \"balance of payment\" of the country.\n\nThe diversion from hundi to here was essentially a macro issue because households were continuing to get the same amount that they were getting in the past, he said.\n\n\"So, we have now added to our foreign exchange reserves and improved official balance of payments,\" he added.\n\nHe said the problem that should essentially be addressed is the about one crore people who, going abroad after 45 years, are still \"disempowered individuals\" and at \"the mercy of the market\".\n\nCPD Distinguished Fellow Prof Mustafizur Rahman, founding chair of Refugee and Migratory Movements Research Unit Prof Tasneem Siddiqui, and Centre for Non Resident Bangladeshis Chairperson MS Shekil Chowdhury, among others, addressed the virtual dialogue."

          "title": "Cottage Industry, SMEs: Tk 2,700cr fresh stimulus unveiled",
          "text": "With small businesses still struggling to recover from the pandemic-induced economic slowdown, the government has rolled out two fresh stimulus packages involving Tk 2,700 crore to boost the cottage industry and SMEs and expand the social security scheme for the elderly and widows in poverty-stricken areas.\n\nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday approved the new schemes also aimed at improving the living standards of rural marginalised people, according to a finance ministry statement.\n\n\"The implementation of the new packages will begin soon,\" it reads.\n\nWith these two, the government has so far rolled out 23 bailout packages announced at different times since March last year to absorb the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe total amount of financial assistance now stands at Tk 124,053 crore, 4.44 percent of the country's GDP.\n\nThe approval of the new schemes comes following recommendations from various stakeholders during a series of dialogue organised recently by the finance ministry on overall aspects of the stimulus packages.\n\nAt the discussions, business leaders, government officials and representatives from banks, development partners and agencies suggested expanding the credit coverage through government and semi-government agencies related to the cottage industry and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).\n\nThey also recommended steps to improve the living standards of marginal people and expand the social safety coverage for the poor, added the finance ministry statement.\n\nPACKAGE FOR SMES, COTTAGE INDUSTRY\n\nUnder the first package involving Tk 1,500 crore, the government will give loans to micro and cottage entrepreneurs through various government and semi-government agencies like the SME Foundation, the BSCIC and Bangladesh NGO Foundation to infuse dynamism into the rural economy amid the pandemic.\n\nOf the amount, Tk 300 crore will be provided to the SME Foundation for expanding its operations for the cottage industry and SMEs alongside helping the female entrepreneurs.\n\nThe SME foundation will disburse loans among the small businesses and entrepreneurs hit hard due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic, said finance ministry officials.\n\nBesides, Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) will get Tk 100 crore under the package.\n\nThe state-run corporation, established to support small initiatives across the country, will provide loans to small entrepreneurs and industrial units set up in the BSCIC estates under its existing credit programmes.\n\nThe package also includes financial support for business initiatives by women who suffered due to the economic slowdown.\n\nJoyeeta Foundation, a government initiative to support women's ventures and empower women financially, will get Tk 50 crore. Apart from the loans, the foundation will provide training to women entrepreneurs.\n\nThe NGO Foundation will get Tk 50 crore for providing small loans through NGOs.\n\nBesides, Social Development Foundation, Palli Daridro Bimochon Foundation, and Bangladesh Palli Development Board will get Tk 300 crore each and Small Farmers Development Foundation Tk 100 crore.\n\nThe government has not yet decided on the interest rates for the loans to be provided through all these organisations and agencies, said finance ministry officials.\n\n\"Before releasing the funds, the Finance Division will discuss and review their existing rates and fix it. But the beneficiaries will get the loans at a reduced rate,\" said one of the officials, seeking anonymity.\n\nIn March last year, the government announced a Tk 20,000-crore stimulus package for the cottage, micro, small and medium enterprise (CMSME) sector after the pandemic hit the country. However, the disbursement rate of the loans was low compared to that for the large industrial and service sectors.\n\nTalking to The Daily Star, Zahid Hussain, former lead economist at the World Bank's Dhaka office, said, \"These are steps in the right direction, but the devil is in the details, as always.\"\n\nThe key parameters of the Tk 1,500-crore package for CMSMEs is unclear, he pointed out.\n\n\"The money will be provided as credit to enterprises in the rural areas. What will be the interest rate at the recipient level and the repayment period? Who will bear the risk?\"\n\nThe inclusion of medium-sized enterprises may frustrate the objective since they are not exactly the most distressed and deprived of assistance under the previous packages, he said.\n\nThe involvement of the NGOs and semi-government institutions is welcome, but one cannot but wonder whether the assistance is spread too thin across too many institutions, Zahid said.\n\nSuggesting review of the distribution of allocations to these institutions based on performance, he said the entire package could be provided as grants to micro, cottage and small enterprises faced with existential threats.\n\n\"Many of them are currently not in a position to take on additional debt because of depressed cash flows as business is still dull, although perhaps better than in the first half of 2020. A one-shot infusion of grant money would help recapitalise and thereby keep these enterprises afloat.\"\n\nTHE SECOND PACKAGE\n\nUnder the Tk 1,200-crore package, all disadvantaged elderly people, widows and female divorcees in 150 poverty-stricken upazilas of the country will get cash assistance. The beneficiaries will get an allowance of Tk 500 a month.\n\nThe package will be implemented in fiscal 2021-2022.\n\nThe amount is likely to increase by 5 percent from the next budget as the finance ministry has already made a decision in this regard, said an official of the ministry.\n\nHowever, the government is yet to finalise the number of beneficiaries.\n\nIt started giving the cash incentives to all those who fall under the beneficiary groups in 112 poverty-stricken upazilas after the pandemic hit the country.\n\nReferring to the allowance, Zahid said it seems the additional social assistance will be provided to new beneficiaries so that all the elderly people and distressed women in the rural areas are covered by fiscal 2022.\n\n\"Proper listing of eligible beneficiaries and pilferage-free transfer of the cash payments have been and remain the key challenges in this regard. The adequacy of the benefits per person remain an open question,\" he said."

It will start gradually,\" a senior official involved with the plans told The Daily Star yesterday.\n\nThere will be vaccination points at four government medical college hospitals, 30 private medical college hospitals, and around 20 specialised hospitals and institutes.\n\nOutside the capital, people will be inoculated at government hospitals and specialised hospitals.\n\nA total of 7,344 teams will be deployed across the country to carry out the campaign. There will be two vaccinators and four volunteers in each team that will inoculate around 150 people a day. The vaccinators will include nurses, said officials with knowledge of the plans.\n\nThe DGHS will hold regular briefings to prevent the spread of rumours, and security measures will be in place during transportation and vaccination.\n\nShamsul Haque Mridha, member secretary of the National Covid-19 Vaccination Plan, said the number of vaccination points would be finalised in a meeting on Tuesday.\n\nShamsul, also the director of Expanded Programme on Immunization, said the home ministry was informed about the need for additional security measures.\n\n\"A team from the Prime Minister's Office has started working on it. They will monitor the security measures,\" he added.\n\nThe DGHS has been training the people who will implement the programme in the field, and eventually those in administrative positions will get the training.\n\nIndia launched the world's largest coronavirus vaccination programme on Saturday. Over 1.6 lakh healthcare and sanitary workers at the frontline of India's Covid-19 battle got their first jab on the very first day of the programme.\n\nBangladesh will get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine from Serum Institute of India by January 25, said officials.\n\nBangladesh has purchased three crore shots of the Oxford vaccine from Serum for $4 per shot, according to the tripartite agreement signed between the government, Serum and Beximco on November 5 last year.\n\nAs per the contract, Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd will deliver the three crore doses to the district level EPI storages from Serum in six phases.\n\nIt was decided earlier that those aged under 18 and those who are pregnant would not get the vaccine shots. Each person would get two shots in a space of between eight and 12 weeks.\n\nOfficials are expecting 50 lakh shots to arrive in the first shipment.\n\nPeople expressed scepticism about the shipment after Serum CEO Adar Poonawalla earlier this month said in an interview with the Associated Press that, \"The vaccine has been granted emergency authorisation by the Indian regulator on Sunday, but on the condition that Serum Institute doesn't export the shots to ensure that vulnerable populations in India are protected.\n\n\"We can only give the vaccines to the government of India at the moment,\" he said, adding that the decision was also made to prevent hoarding.\n\nPoonawalla further said the \"company also has been barred from selling the vaccine in the private market\".\n\nBesides, Serum was planning to give 200 to 300 million doses to COVAX by December 2021, said the AP report.\n\nThe report also observed that the ban on export \"means that poorer nations will probably have to wait a few months before receiving their first shots\".\n\nOfficials then urged people not to worry."

          "text": "US President Donald Trump at this point is opting not to issue a pardon for himself as he prepares an expansive list of more than 100 pardons and commutations for release on Tuesday, a source familiar with the effort said.\n\nWhite House advisers have said Trump has privately debated with advisers whether to take the extraordinary step of issuing a pardon for himself but some administration officials have cautioned Trump against a self-pardon because it would make him look guilty.\n\nMany scholars have said a self-pardon would be unconstitutional because it violates the basic principle that nobody should be the judge in his or her own case.\n\nOthers have argued that a self-pardon is constitutional because the pardon power is very broadly worded in the Constitution. Historical texts made clear that the nation's 18th century founders discussed self-pardons, but opted not to include an explicit limitation on that power.\n\nTrump was impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives last week on charges of inciting the storming of the US Capitol on Jan. 6 by pro-Trump protesters. His case is to face a Senate trial and if convicted, he could be disqualified from seeking another run for the presidency in 2024.\n\nThe source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said so far Trump does not plan to pardon himself and also does not plan to issue preemptive pardons for members of his family, another subject he has discussed privately with advisers.\n\nTrump, who has already issued two waves of pardons in the past month, met advisers on Sunday to finalize a list of more than 100 pardons and commutations, the source said.\n\nCNN reported that Dr Salomon Melgen, a prominent eye doctor from Palm Beach who is in prison after being convicted on dozens of counts of health care fraud, is expected to be on the clemency list.\n\nThe source said the clemencies were expected to be issued on Trump's last full day in office on Tuesday. Skipping the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, Trump leaves on Wednesday morning to begin his post-presidency at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. His presidency ends at noon on Wednesday."
